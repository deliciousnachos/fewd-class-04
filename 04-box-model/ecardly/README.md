# HTML & CSS Reps!

Web developers are often asked to produce websites or web applications based on design specs, wireframes, or full mockups. Today we're going to get some practice writing HTML and CSS to recreate mockups. 

## Brook&Lyn :dancers:

- The trendy clothing brand Brook&Lyn needs a new website and has asked you to build it for them!
- In the `brook_and_lyn_starter` folder, a designer provided a file called `mockup.png` as your visual guide. Luckily, they are a cool client and allow for some "creative freedom." Don't worry if it's not a perfect match!
- You should also include a media query to make the font size larger on mobile.
- The client has provided the assets you'll need to build their site including images and stylesheets.
- Write your HTML in `index.html` and your CSS in `style.css`.
- You **DO NOT** need to change anything in `reset.css`!!!
